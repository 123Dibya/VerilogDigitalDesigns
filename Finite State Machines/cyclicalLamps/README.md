# Cyclical Lamps  

There are three lamps- RED, GREEN and YELLOW that should glow cyclically with a fixed time interval. (say 1 second).  

The FSM has three states, corresponding to the the glowing state of any one of the lamps.  
The input set is NULL and state transition occurs each time the clock signal comes.  
This is a Moore machine, since the lamps that will glow only depends on the state and not on the inputs.
