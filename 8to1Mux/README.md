# 8 to 1 Multiplexer  

The [synthesized_outputTechIndependent.v]() is the technology independent gate level netlist synthesized from the [8to1Mux.v]() RTL description with the help of Yosys HLS tool.  

The [synthesized_output.v](https://github.com/AbhijitBaral/VerilogDigitalDesigns/blob/main/8to1Mux/synthesized_outputTechIndependent.v) is the the same design technology mapped for Lattice iCE40 FPGA.
