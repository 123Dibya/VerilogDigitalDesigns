# Full Adder  

Performs 1 bit Binary Arithmetic Addition on inputs in1, in2 and Cin(Carry input)  

The Full Adder is written in Structural description by instantiating two Half Adder modules, which are described as "halfAdder"
in another file "halfAdder.v". 

* SchemFA.circ - Logisim Schematic of Full Adder

* tbFullAdder - Test bench for "fullAdder.v"  
* FA - Binary Compiled by Icarus Verilog  
* tbFullAdder.vcd - Dump file for waveform visualization
